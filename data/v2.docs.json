["[[toc]]\n","# Workplace Resources Guide { #intro updated=\"2025-01-29\" }\n\nThis Workplace Resources Guide compiles tools from the journalism industry, LGBTQ+ organizations, legal experts, and security advisors. The guide addresses newsroom leaders who may be seeking to support trans employees or contractors as well as workers who may need resources to present to their manager. It also contains numerous do-it-yourself toolkits for journalists.\n\nAlthough this guide has been compiled with trans journalists in mind, much of it will be useful for any journalist — especially when it comes to assessing risk and improving digital hygiene. As with many elements of diversity, equity, and inclusion, creating a safer and more thoughtful environment for trans journalists will foster a more positive work environment for journalists of all identities.\n\nThis guide contains the following sections:\n\n- [**Holistic Safety Guide**](#section-safety)**:** links to recorded trainings and duty of care recommendations, as well as resources for supporting individuals’ psychological, digital, and physical safety;\n- [**Trans-Inclusive Workplace Policies**](#section-policies)**:** written policy best practices, recommendations about pronoun disclosure, and workplace transition plans;\n- [**Additional Resources**](#section-additional-resources)**:** links from diversity, equity, and inclusion-focused journalism organizations and LGBTQ+ legal resources.\n\n_If you run into a workplace issue that isn’t addressed in this guide — or you’re just trying to figure out how to interpret and apply_ _its contents_ _— please reach out to_ [_contact@transjournalists.org_](mailto:contact@transjournalists.org)_._\n\n_The inclusion of any individual resource within this document is not an endorsement of the organization offering the resource, nor is it a statement that the resource is complete, accessible, or equitable. Users of this resource are asked to assess each item on an individual basis and use their best judgement to evaluate its usefulness.

Additional resources and support were provided by [Aegis Safety Alliance](https://www.aegissafetyalliance.org/) (Jen Byers + Tara Pixley) funded through the [2024 Knight Election Hub](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/announcing-the-knight-election-hub-to-support-newsrooms/) Urgent Care project. \n\n## Trainings and Services { #subsection-safety-trainings updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n\nReceiving a full, in-person safety training prepares reporters to understand digital and physical safety. These resources can supplement more robust trainings or provide an alternative for those unable to access in-person trainings.\n\n### Past TJA trainings { #tja-trainings updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n**Please note** that these trainings are only viewable if you are [logged in on the members site](https://members.transjournalists.org/Sys/Login).\n\n- [IRE training for TJA membership](https://members.transjournalists.org/IRE-220507): Digital Security \n  - [PowerPoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-4WwrAP1cfOn12JJBvCJM0zNJbRQ3-Ie/edit?rtpof=true)\n  - [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IryAFCPIXVubd18HeutAcz_wyV4hVqnS/view?usp=sharing)\n- [IWMF training: Demystifying Digital Security](http://members.transjournalists.org/page-18090)\n\n### Free safety services for journalists  { #free-safety-resources updated=\"2025-02-07\" }\n- [INN](https://inn.org/resources/press-freedom-and-safety-hub/) [Press Freedom & Safety Hub](https://inn.org/resources/press-freedom-and-safety-hub/)\n- [IWMF free security consultations for journalists who may face digital threats](https://iwmf.submittable.com/submit/165075/one-on-one-safety-consultation)\n- [PEN America online abuse defense training program](https://pen.org/online-abuse-defense-training-program/)\n- The [Online Violence Response Hub](https://onlineviolenceresponsehub.org/) consolidates over 130 resources for critical areas such as digital security training, documentation and reporting abuse, emergency assistance, newsroom protocols, strategies for responding to abuse, and legal support.\n- [SAFE Journalist Training and Resources](https://www.rtdna.org/safety) | RTDNA\n\n## Duty of Care and Newsroom Culture { #subsection-newsroom-safety updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nFreelancers, assigning editors, and newsrooms should have conversations about their duty of care and contractual obligations early in the assignment planning process. \n\nNewsrooms should clearly articulate what freelancers can expect in terms of legal support, travel, and/or health insurance (including post-assignment psychological support) as needed. Freelancers can request a collective overview of the risk assessment for an assignment to open conversation on the newsroom’s duty of care. \n\n### Resources for newsroom leaders  { #newsroom-leadership-resources updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- [Best Practices for Employers and Newsroom Leadership](https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/best-practices-for-employers/) | PEN America\n- [News Org Safety Self-Assessment](https://www.acosalliance.org/_files/ugd/c1a6a6_2ff5d2a2540f45a7be5536aa3b87ad37.pdf) | ACOS: Newsrooms should complete this assessment before assigning staff or freelancers to reporting with any level of potential risk. \n- [Editor Safety Hub](https://editorsafetyhub.org/home) | ACOS/WAN-IFRA: This 3-hour online course helps newsroom leaders understand how to best cultivate a culture of safe assigning and commissioning practices.\n- [Freelance Publishing Agreement](https://www.acosalliance.org/contracts) | ACOS: This contract template helps freelancers engage assigning editors and newsrooms in conversations around legal responsibilities \n\n### Risk assessment  { #risk-assessment updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- [Risk Assessment Assignment Checklist | ACOS + Aegis](https://www.acosalliance.org/_files/ugd/c1a6a6_d28c9352aeee47d7ae70522672ace7f1.pdf): Use this quick checklist for every assignment.

Individual situations and locations all require individual evaluation, and the political climate of a broad region may not necessarily reflect the risks present at a given event. \n\n## Psychological Safety { #subsection-psychological-safety updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n\nTaking care of your mental health is as important as safeguarding your physical safety. These resources support journalists in preparing for difficult assignments, recognizing the signs of trauma, and managing the mental health impacts of practicing journalism.   \n\n### Mental health resources  { #mental-health updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n_General support_\n- [Psychological First Aid Primer | J-SOS](https://www.sourceofsafety.org/PSYCHE-PRIMER.pdf): This quick guide helps you respond to a person in psychological distress i.e. having an anxiety, PTSD or panic attack – or a person who is in shock in the aftermath of a traumatic event. \n- [Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org): hotline for peer support and [community-based](https://translifeline.org/resources/community-based-crisis-support/) resources\n\n_Therapy and guides_\n- [Resources for Journalists Seeking Therapy](https://www.jtsn.org/resources-for-journalists): provider directory and other resources from Journalism Trauma Support Network\n- [Journalists and Mental Health](https://americanpressinstitute.org/mental-health-resources-for-journalists/): general tips and resources guide from American Press Institute\n- [Resources for Coping & Safety](https://www.nabj.org/page/CopingSafetyResources): trauma support and self-care for Black journalists from NABJ\n\n### Safety with sources  { #source-safety updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- Having clear boundaries with sources is _key_. \n- Never over-promise to a source. Be transparent about the editorial process.\n- Do not get personally or romantically involved with a source.\n- Keep your journalistic role and independence _clear_. This is an aspect of safety. Some of the worst harassment campaigns can come from former sources. Help avoid this by setting clear boundaries at all points in your professional interactions.\n- Consider source reticence and work to build trust.\n  - [“Why Should I Tell You?”: A Guide to Less-Extractive Reporting](https://ethics.journalism.wisc.edu/why-should-i-tell-you-a-guide-to-less-extractive-reporting/)\n  - Community awareness can [bolster safety](https://rjionline.org/news/reporting-in-spaces-of-civil-unrest/).\n- Building relationships with sources _before_ difficult events or conflict makes them more likely to talk during conflict and builds trust generally. Often, folks are closed off and protective on the day of a protest, so it may be difficult to make connections.\n\n## Information Security Checklist { #subsection-byline-checklist updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nPast bylines are sometimes used as vectors for harassment. If you’re changing your byline, or have previously changed your byline but want to locate additional information associated with your past name, here are some resource checklists and places to look.\n\n### Locating and removing pre-transition information { #checklist-information-removal updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- Look yourself up online and remove data\n  - Delete or make private all images of a pre-transition self, if necessary.\n  - Untag yourself from photos or images posted pre-transition, if necessary.\n  - Remove content from sites that you own.\n  - Request that search engines remove other information.\n  - Request that the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) remove content\n  - Request that Google and Apple Maps blur out your address, if applicable.\n- Set up two-factor authentication for services using Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, or another service, and secure your accounts with them.\n- Use a password manager to store and create your passwords.\n### Developing a byline change plan for the workplace { #checklist-byline-change-before updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- Decide on a day when you would like to socially transition at your workplace.\n- Inform your HR department and supervisor of your intent to transition. For support with this process, see [_Developing a Workplace Transition Plan_](#subsection-transition-plan).\n- Make a list of services (like CMSes, newswire access, professional communication platforms) that will have to be updated if you change your name and its associated email handle.\n- Write a coming out note and coordinate with your supervisor on announcements, if you wish. You may also consider writing a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section in your note to answer any questions people may have\n### How to change your byline { #checklist-byline-change-during updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- Change your username and name on social media services: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/420650638385270?id=867336363714190), [Instagram/Threads](https://help.instagram.com/583107688369069), [Twitter/X](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/change-x-handle), [LinkedIn display name](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1338854/changing-how-your-name-appears-on-your-profile), [LinkedIn public profile URL](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a542685), among others.\n- Update services that you use for work if you have changed your name and associated email handle.\n- [Claim your profile](https://help.muckrack.com/en/articles/2510844-step-by-step-process-for-claiming-a-journalist-profile-on-muck-rack) with Muck Rack (if you have yet to do so) and change your name there.\n- Make a public announcement if you wish.\n- Make a list of places where your former byline would appear and look up their contacts. Request a change in byline in places you no longer work at\n### After you change your byline { #checklist-byline-change-after updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- Create a separate email to create new social media accounts that will be used to park your old social media handles/usernames.\n- Park your old social media handles with a new account:\n  - Immediately (for Twitter/X, Bluesky, or Mastodon)\n  - After two weeks (for Instagram/Threads)\n  - After 4 months (Facebook)\n- Secure these accounts with two factor authentication.\n- Maintain these old accounts once every 6 to 12 months.\n\n## Digital Security { #subsection-digital-safety updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nAssess your digital safety pre-assignment by “doxxing yourself”: Look yourself up online to see what information is available, who might be able to access it, and how. Lock down your data, profile, and other sensitive info using the tools below.  \n\n### Communications { #digital-communications updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- Use encrypted communication (e.g. Signal) as much as possible when talking with sources or other reporters.\n- Use a VPN when researching.\n- Consider secure or encrypted data storage.\n- Include communications plans and digital threats in your [risk assessment planning](https://rorypecktrust.org/how-we-help/freelance-resources/downloads/) (and see our [_risk assessment_](#risk-assessment) resources).\n\n### Digital safety resources { #digital-safety updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- [Online Harassment Field Manual](https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/) | PEN America \n- [Digital Safety Kit](https://cpj.org/2019/07/digital-safety-kit-journalists/) | Committee to Protect Journalists\n- [Digital and Physical Safety: Protecting Confidential Sources](https://cpj.org/2021/11/digital-physical-safety-protecting-confidential-sources/) | CPJ\n- [Physical and digital safety: Civil disorder](https://cpj.org/2018/09/physical-safety-civil-disorder/) | CPJ\n- [Physical and digital safety: Arrest and detention](https://cpj.org/2021/02/physical-and-digital-safety-arrest-and-detention/) | CPJ\n- [Digital Safety Snacks](https://pen.org/digital-safety-snacks/) | PEN America\n\n### Do-it-yourself information management { #diy-info-management updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n- [How to dox yourself before someone else can](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IOLBg7lxqEdqyFGIiZUnpF_4oBJRDNqp/view?usp=sharing)\n- [How to choose the right information removal service](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FIj_sc-UDyeBLKZx_5lc99gcWI_B_NAp/view?usp=sharing)\n- [How to remove your own information from data brokers](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List)\n- [How other people will find your information — and how to stop them](https://guides.accessnow.org/self-doxing.html)\n- [How to disrupt and prevent digital harassment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/173QIhW2UbWeAEcGWTtPWAmP53m8SMeRo/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Data broker tools { #data-brokers updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nThere are a number of services that will remove your information from data brokers on your behalf — for a fee.

We recommend that all journalists use a personal password manager that is separate from any employer-offered tool. 1Password has particularly good mutli-account support; Bitwarden has a very reliable free, open source plan.\n\n_Guides to protecting_ _personal data/protecting against online abuse_\n- [Coalition Against Online Violence](https://onlineviolenceresponsehub.org/)\n- [A Guide to Protecting Newsrooms and Journalists Against Online Violence](https://www.iwmf.org/newsroom-policy-guide/) | IWMF\n- [A Mental Health Guide for Journalists Facing Online Violence](https://www.iwmf.org/mental-health-guide/) | IWMF\n- [Online Violence](https://www.iwmf.org/programs/online-harassment/) | IWMF\n\n## Physical Safety in Protest Coverage { #subsection-protest-physical-safety updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n### Digital surveillance { #digital-surveillance updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nLaw enforcement targets dissidents with surveillance. The same techniques can also be used against journalists — both by the state and by civilian bad actors.\n\n- Study the digital surveillance tactics used against [activists](https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2023/01/26/if-protests-are-now-terrorism-what-is-state-brutality-and-surveillance/) and [January 6th rioters](https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/jan-6-series-how-osint-powered-the-largest-criminal-investigation-in-us-history/) to understand ways you might be targeted. \n- Anything you post can and will be used against you. Be careful about sharing personal data, especially location photos, details, or live updates.\n- Consider using a VPN on your phone while reporting on protests.\n- Use encrypted communications, like Signal.\n\n### Situational awareness { #situational-awareness updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nThe best way to avoid danger is to stay aware of your surroundings. Being aware is a process: continuously survey, collect information, assess, and reassess.\n\n_Resources for covering protests_\n- [SAFE Training: Situational Awareness](https://www.rtdna.org/article/safe_training_part_1_situational_awareness) | RTDNA\n- [SAFE Training: Verbal De-Escalation](https://www.rtdna.org/article/safe_training_part_3_verbal_de_escalation) | RTDNA\n- [CPJ Training: Protests, Policing and Crowds](https://youtu.be/t4x7SsIs4T0?si=E-qEHMNlkA_BPdD9)\n\n_Tips for covering protests_\n  - Research police tactics used in your area. \n    - Things to prepare for: kettling, teargas, pepper spray, “MOVE BACK” line pushes, rubber bullets, bean bag projectiles\n    - Police violence typically escalates at night and when very few journalists are around. Police are most likely to target journalists when there are few other witnesses.\n  - If in a protest, continue moving. Move in a flower pattern, going into the crowd and out of it, so you can see the entire situation and how it’s developing. \n<img style=\"max-width: 200px\" a href=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdJOI-ARWqDI7BFkunHNtOSQpCTiI2KnkoeYqz58_HT1QNMZW7gw1HBb8JVSQnmi88SKIObBuhOWZ4vIY-EFg6tWSpOoeOCxK8skxAZGlwv2BNkM7stuC13BqeXE8cEy4SMDGaG?key=WuOaGz2jUpQQI_GV0aLbcoXr\">\n  - Look at a satellite view of the protest location beforehand. Identify choke points and exit routes. \n  - If possible, find high ground to assess the scene. This will help you identify shifts in the crowd, including helping you predict kettles.\n  - Stay at least 10 feet away from the police at all times. Make sure they can’t grab you _or_ lunge and grab you.\n  - Survey area for things you can [take cover](https://theprepared.com/self-defense/guides/common-objects-stop-bullets/) or hide behind if someone starts shooting. If hiding behind a car, hide behind the engine block. \n  - Prepare yourself with local legal resources. Who can you call if you get arrested? Consider writing their number on your arm in Sharpie because you might not have access to written notes.\n  - Carry cash and any necessary medications in case you are arrested.\n  - Back up photos and data as much as possible in case you are arrested or your device is seized.\n\n_Questions to ask during research_\n- What is the political climate of the area I’m going into? \n- Are the civilians hostile or welcoming to trans people and/or the press? Are the police? The protest/activist groups?\n- Have there been any recent or historical attacks on the press or LGBTQ+ people?\n- Are the local police/sheriffs/etc. known to use certain tactics or use certain munitions? \n\n### Profile-building  { #profile-building updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nYour profile is a combination of your dress, your gear, and how you carry yourself. Sometimes you want to stand out and other times you want to blend in. Sometimes you want to look “fancy,” other times plain, still other times punk. Deciding how you want to build your profile is up to you, but part of safety planning is to think through how you can best prepare yourself to work effectively and safely, while also recognizing what your attire will say about you to others. \n\n_Questions to ask yourself_\n- Do I want to be very visibly a reporter (e.g. neutral clothing, press pass out, gear visible)? \n- Do I want to blend in to appear that you are not attending in a professional capacity (e.g. use a smartphone to report and photograph)?\n- What gear do I need to do my job? \n  - Will having too much (or too little) impede me from moving? \n  - Will having too much (or too little) make me a target for anti-press violence?\n  - Is my gear a snag hazard?\n- What is the dress code of the event? \n  - Will people be dressed more business/professional or casual? \n- What physical liability does my clothing expose me to?\n  - How much skin am I exposing? \n  - Do I need skin protection, abrasion resistance?\n  - Should my clothing be flame resistant? (i.e. natural materials, not plastic).\n- How likely is it that I’ll need to run?\n- Are there any signifiers relevant to the area that could mark me as a member of a group or ideology? Do I want to lean into that or avoid that? (e.g. wearing all black, black/yellow, a red hat, an American flag).\n- If I have multiple gender presentations, which will make me feel the most comfortable, safe, and able to do my job?\n\n### Civil unrest gear and personal protective equipment   { #civil-unrest-ppe updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nMuch of the available safety gear for protest and other hazardous reporting environments is made with cisgender men’s bodies in mind and has visibly militaristic characteristics. It is safer to keep a lower profile in civil unrest environments. For instance, if you have eye protection and a mask to filter chemical attacks, keep these handy to don when needed but not in plain sight, if possible. \n\n- [PPE Primer | Journalism Source of Safety](https://www.sourceofsafety.org/PPE-PRIMER.pdf) | [J-SOS] : This quick guide is aimed toward basic info for freelancers and needs of a protest environment. \n- [SAFE Training: Civil Unrest and High-Risk Events](https://www.rtdna.org/article/safe_training_part_2_civil_unrest_and_high_risk_events) | RTDNA\n- [A Guide to PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)](https://cpj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PPE-Glossary_CPJ-FINAL.pdf) | CPJ: This guide is geared toward a war/conflict environment and is helpful for detailed info but may not be relevant for protest reporting. \n- [Civil Unrest Safety Briefing](https://www.sourceofsafety.org/civil-unrest#civilunrestgear) | J-SOS:  Some key, basic knowledge for preparing yourself to report safely in civil unrest situations. \n- [Reporting in spaces of civil unrest](https://rjionline.org/news/reporting-in-spaces-of-civil-unrest/) | Reynolds Journalism Institute\n- [First Aid Briefing](https://www.sourceofsafety.org/first-aid#firstaidgear) | J-SOS: This resource provides an overview of key first aid knowledge and recommends specific items to have on you for your personal individual first aid kit (I-FAK) \n\n_Equipment to consider carrying_\n- Active ear protection and ear plugs\n- Eye goggles or gas mask, in case of tear gas or pepper spray \n- Self-defense equipment\n\n_About self-defense equipment_\n\nExperts recommend having access to small tools you can quickly and effectively use in the event of physical aggression toward you. **Only carry self-defense tools that you have trained to use.** Research and understand the legality of any tool that you carry, as well as applicable self-defense and assault laws. **Always aim for de-escalation and/or escape.** \n- If pepper spray is legal in your area, self-defense experts recommend carrying it because it maintains distance, which improves your ability to remain safe and escape. It also carries lower legal liability than other commonly recommended tools.\n- Some recommend tactical pens and tasers. However, these items often have regulatory and legal restrictions that change from city-to-city and are difficult to research, especially when purchased online. They must also be used at a close distance, which may hinder escape. Safety experts recommend a tool that allows users to create and maintain physical distance, like pepper spray, over tactical pens whenever possible. \n\n_Resources_\n- [De-escalation and Use of Force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21mXO37jLLU) [Video Tutorial]\n- [Self-defense tactics for trans and nonbinary folks](https://getplume.co/blog/self-defense-for-trans-and-nonbinary-folks/) | Plume\n- [Should you use a tactical pen for self-defense?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2-EDLoFnF4&ab_channel=EliteYou) [Video Tutorial]\n- [SAFE Training: Situational Awareness](https://www.rtdna.org/article/safe_training_part_1_situational_awareness) | RTDNA\n- [SAFE Training: Verbal De-Escalation](https://www.rtdna.org/article/safe_training_part_3_verbal_de_escalation) | RTDNA\n\n## General Physical Safety { #subsection-general-physical-safety updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n### First aid  { #first-aid updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\nIt is generally best-practice to carry gloves, gauze, and tourniquets in high-risk situations.\n\n_Additional first aid resources_\n- [First Aid Primer](https://www.sourceofsafety.org/FIRSTAID-PRIMER.pdf) | J-SOS: This quick guide provides an overview of what to look for when your or someone near you has been physically injured.

It may be worthwhile to look for a class or group in your area, to build confidence and ensure you are able to get out of dangerous situations safely. \n\nLook for gyms with classes focused on practical self-defense skills, e.g. tactics like “disable and escape.” Some martial arts forms, such as krav maga and others commonly used by military or police, assume that their practitioners have qualified immunity. These martial arts forms may teach tactics that escalate, rather than defuse, unsafe situations, or that may increase your legal liability as a civilian. If looking to seriously learn self-defense, it is best to practice both a grappling art and a striking art. Classes on de-escalation and first aid are also recommended.\n\nYou can assess whether the gym and trainers are trans-inclusive by calling ahead, reading reviews, or browsing their website. If you have local community who wants to study together, many gyms will allow for smaller, private lessons focused on the group’s needs and skill set.\n\n### Evaluating bathroom access on assignment  { #bathroom-access updated=\"2025-01-28\" }\n_Resources_\n- [Map of Laws for Bathroom Bans](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/nondiscrimination/bathroom_bans) | Movement Advancement Project\n- [Tips for if Confronted in the Restroom](https://legacy.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-bathroom-tips) & [FAQ about Restroom Use Best Practice](https://legacy.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-restroom-faq) | Lambda Legal\n- [Tips to Share with Allies](https://19thnews.org/2024/03/bathroom-safety-trans-nonbinary-people/) | The 19th\n- [Legal Regulations and Tips to Share with Office](https://www.thehrcfoundation.org/professional-resources/restroom-access-for-transgender-employees)  | HRC\n- [Best Practices for Office Bathrooms](https://outandequal.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Best-Practices-Restrooms-2017-1.pdf) | Out and Equal\n- Crowd-sourced [database of Refuge Restrooms](https://refugerestrooms.org/about)\n\n_Tips_\n- Research ahead if reporting at a new location. (E.g. call ahead; ask sources for recommendations; look up laws, political temperature, or a building map.)\n- If a location is known to be notably hostile, find out: Are there gender-neutral or single-stall restrooms? Is there an LGBTQ+-friendly local business nearby? \n- Consider the buddy system. Backwatchers are good in most scenarios.\n- Know and believe that you are supposed to be there, so your mannerisms convey that to others.","# Trans-inclusive Workplace Policies { #section-policies updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n\n## Written Policy Best Practices { #subsection-written-policies updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n\n### General policy { #workplace-general updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- Have a workplace write anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy that explicitly include sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression as protected categories.\n- Have clear policies that outline expected behavior and protocol concerning workplace education, LGBTQ+ issues coverage, and other categories covered by this guide. \n- Keep a Workplace Transition Plan that follows best practices (see [Developing a Workplace Transition Plan](#subsection-transition-plan) and [Additional resources](#section-additional-resources).)\n- Maintain a list of contacts who can answer questions related to the Workplace Transition Plan, records, and internal policies.\n- Introduce all workplace policies to every employee as part of onboarding.\n\n### Workplace education { #workplace-education updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- Employers should provide and encourage consistent workplace education on transgender issues, regardless of whether a workplace contains any openly transgender employees. This will improve coverage of transgender communities as well as foster a safer workplace environment for all employees. \n- Whenever possible, this education should come from professional organizations that provide in-person, full-workplace training. Mandatory online programs are also acceptable if bringing in trained professionals is not feasible.\n- If necessary, additional education should be provided when transgender employees enter the workplace. However, general education already provided to employees should cover any topics that would become relevant upon an out transgender employee entering the workplace.\n- LGBTQ+ and other underrepresented employees should not be asked to provide workplace education to their coworkers.\n### LGBTQ issues coverage { #lgbtq-coverage updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- LGBTQ+ and other under-represented employees should not be expected to provide editorial guidance or sensitivity reads outside of the scope of their typical work. \n  - Newsrooms that do request sensitivity reads, translations, or other work outside the scope of an employee’s typical duties should consider codifying a policy to provide those employees with compensation comparable to what would be paid to an outside contractor. \n- LGBTQ+ employees should not be taken off any story on trans communities because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. \n- LGBTQ+ employees should not be automatically assigned stories on LGBTQ issues solely because of their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n### Privacy { #privacy updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- Employees have a right to decide whether and when to disclose and discuss their gender and identity.\n- Management, human resources, and other colleagues should not disclose or discuss an employee’s transgender status without obtaining prior consent.\n- Disclosing an employee’s transgender status can constitute a violation of medical privacy laws, such as HIPAA.\n### Names and pronouns { #names-pronouns updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- All records should reflect an employee’s chosen name, rather than legal name, even if they have not changed their legal name — unless required by outside institutions (such as by payroll and bank records).\n- As a best practice, newsrooms should update past and future bylines for transgender employees without requiring documentation. This is a matter of both accuracy and safety, as the easy availability of trans journalists’ past bylines facilitates harassment. \n- In newsrooms with technical systems that would re-publish past stories if bylines were updated (e.g. news wires), updating bylines may out employees or cause other issues. It's important to inform employees of how and where updated information could appear, and also to consider this while developing internal policies around byline changes.\n- In newsrooms that use CMS systems that share stories between multiple partner sites, old bylines and user profiles may appear on other sites for which the employer does not have edit access. Appoint a manager or human resources employee to contact other outlets to request byline and profile updates for transgender employees. \n- Do not require employees to disclose pronouns in places such as email signatures, business cards, or social accounts. Instead, provide all employees with a newsroom-wide, consistent format for voluntarily including pronouns in relevant venues. Encourage employees to participate regardless of their genders. For additional information, see [_Pronoun Disclosure on Professional Platforms_](#subsection-pronoun-disclosure)_._\n### Harassment policies { #harassment-policies updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- ​​Persistent, malicious refusal to use correct names and pronouns can legally constitute harassment. The relevant laws for your workplace should be noted in workplace anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies.\n- All newsrooms should have policies and procedures for dealing with harassment directed toward reporters by the public. These policies should cover in-person, in-the-field incidents of harassment as well as online harassment. Those policies should specifically include trans journalists. \n- For additional information on external safety and harassment policies, see [_Duty of Care and Newsroom Culture_](#subsection-newsroom-safety).\n### Sex-segregated job assignments and workplace events { #sex-segregation updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- Employees should generally be classified according to their lived gender, not assigned sex at birth, at workplace events unless they choose otherwise.\n- While determining reporting assignments, do not make assumptions about whether a transgender employee would be comfortable or uncomfortable attending and reporting on an event or community that separates groups by gender. Consult the employee. \n### Restrooms and locker rooms { #restrooms updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- It is best practice to have single-use, gender-neutral restrooms available to all employees.\n- Transgender employees should not be denied access to common restrooms or restricted to a single-use restroom.\n- Transgender employees should be allowed to use any restrooms and locker rooms that correspond to their gender. \n### Dress codes { #dress-codes updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- It is best practice to have a dress code that does not restrict manner of dress based on gender and identity.\n- Transgender employees should be able to follow the dress code most appropriate to their gender or gender expression. \n### Health insurance { #health-insurance updated=\"2023-08-05\" }\n- Employers should seek employee medical insurance plans that include and cover transgender health care.\n- Transition-related care should be eligible for any workplace medical leave plans, both individual and state-mandated.\n\n## Pronoun Disclosure on Professional Platforms { #subsection-pronoun-disclosure updated=\"2024-12-20\" }\n\nPronouns are increasingly a standard part of many workplaces’ professional email signatures, along with titles, social media handles, and other boilerplate information. \n\nThis is generally a helpful and practical trend for a few reasons: \n- Many given names are neutral or may have different gender associations across cultures.\n- Making a person’s pronouns easier to find is a simple way of preventing potential miscommunication.\n- Offering nonbinary and other employees who use pronouns besides _he/him_ and _she/her_ a convenient way to note their pronouns can remind cisgender colleagues to use pronouns correctly.\n- Cisgender people who are unlikely to be misgendered but still prominently display their pronouns may help make trans employees feel less conspicuous.\n- Including pronouns in written communication may also help normalize asking for and confirming another person’s pronouns during interviews, source diversity audits, and other professional interactions.\n\nHowever, we do not recommend mandating pronoun disclosures of any kind in the workplace or in other professional contexts.\n\nManagers should feel comfortable _encouraging_ employees to disclose their pronouns publicly, for the reasons noted above — but any individual's decision _not_ to disclose pronouns should not be interrogated. The same principles may apply to social media profiles, event name tags, email signatures, HR platforms, work bios, and in other online or offline interactions. \n\nThere are many reasons a person might prefer not to disclose their pronouns, either in particular situations or across all professional platforms:\n- Trans people who are not out publicly, who change pronouns from day to day, or who use different identifiers in their public and private lives may not want a written, easily shareable record of what pronouns they use at work. \n- Sources or other outside contacts may criticize the very act of disclosing pronouns. This could become a potential safety or privacy issue for journalists of any identity, but for trans employees in particular. \n- And — simply but crucially — some trans people may prefer not to draw attention to their pronouns. \n\nMany common workplace platforms provide the options for employees to include pronouns in an inconspicuous manner in user profiles next to other information, like name pronunciation, job title, and email address. For newsrooms that use Slack, there are [a variety of workspace configuration settings](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500011115781-Manage-pronoun-and-name-pronunciation-display-for-member-profiles) that, when enabled by an administrator, allow employees to add pronouns to their profiles. Other common platforms, including [Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/profile-cards-in-microsoft-365-e80f931f-5fc4-4a59-ba6e-c1e35a85b501) and [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4402698027533-Adding-and-sharing-your-pronouns), also have options to add pronoun fields.\n\nHowever, many users are unaware that these options exist, or do not refer to other users' profiles before addressing them. As a result, many people prefer to include pronouns more conspicuously in their display name, where everyone will see them, e.g.: Jax Doe (they/them). \n\nIf your newsroom is developing any policies related to pronoun use on work platforms, it may be necessary to educate employees about the existence of the less-visible profile options.\n\n## Developing a Workplace Transition Plan { #subsection-transition-plan updated=\"2023-08-25\" }\n\nThis guide walks through important questions and best practices for employers who wish to support employees who decide to transition and come out at work. Such a guide is recommended as a best practice by the Transgender Law Center as well as a number of human resources and diversity, equity, and inclusion organizations. \n\n### Guidelines for the employer { #subsection-transition-plan-guidelines updated=\"2023-08-25\" }\n\n- Emphasize support of employees and their transitions\n- Review relevant nondiscrimination policies\n- Advise coworkers about affirming employees and their transitions\n- Model correct use of transitioning employees’ name and pronouns in all communications\n- Develop processes with participation and consent of transitioning employees\n\n### Questions for the employer { #subsection-transition-plan-employer-questions updated=\"2023-08-25\" }\n\n- Who is the transitioning employee’s point of contact? Someone in HR? Elsewhere?\n- Who will be involved in implementing an employee’s transition plan? This should include the employee, the employee’s direct supervisor, an HR representative, and anyone else who will be involved, per employee’s comfort and permission. \n- Who, if anyone, would have access to records or information containing former names and legal names? Employees should be made aware of this. \n- Does the newsroom owner have relevant policies and procedures that guide or constrain the newsroom’s policies? This may be relevant if the newsroom is owned by a university or larger media conglomerate. \n- How familiar are points of contact expected to be with newsroom policies around transgender issues? How will they be trained, and how will they stay informed after initial training? \n- How will employees know about newsroom policies related to transgender status? This includes but is not limited to policies regarding bathroom use, employment rights, and how to report harassment or discrimination. It also includes transgender health care coverage in newsroom medical plans.\n- Who does the employee need to meet with? Most employees will likely need to consult their immediate supervisor after discussing social transition plans with HR or another primary point person. An employee may desire a larger meeting to inform others of their transition. \n- What records need to be updated for employees? How and when will those changes be made? Can they be made?\n- Consider headshots, newsroom email ID, online display names, press badges, name plates, HR logins, and bylines. If the newsroom is affiliated with a larger conglomerate, there may be systems that can’t be changed without a formal request to a technology department.\n- Employers should ensure all name changes, photographs, and other documents are updated in advance of any announcement, unless the employee prefers a different timeline.\n- What sort of social, medical, and disability leave are available to transitioning employees? Who will communicate with the employee about any relevant leave programs and how to qualify? These programs vary by state laws and by workplace. \n- Who will notify management of the employee’s transition so that newsroom leaders can model appropriate pronouns, names and behavior?\n- What training will be given to coworkers?\n- How will management respond to coworkers or colleagues disrespecting employees based on their transgender status? How will management respond to colleagues who refuse to use the appropriate names and pronouns for transitioning employees? How will employees be made aware of relevant anti-harassment and nondiscrimination laws?\n- How will management respond to harassment or discrimination against transgender employees originating from outside the newsroom? Do existing newsroom policies include transgender reporters when stipulating how to handle harassment at events, while reporting, or on social media? \n\n### Questions for the employee { #subsection-transition-plan-employee-questions updated=\"2023-08-25\" }\n\n- When will the social transition in the office formally occur? This means the date that the employee will change their name and pronouns. They may also start using a different restroom/locker room, if they have not already been using the facilities most appropriate for their gender identity. \n- How and in what format should coworkers be made aware of someone’s new name and pronouns, if relevant?\n- Would they prefer to announce new names and pronouns to relevant coworkers or communicate the information one-on-one? \n- Would they prefer to announce new names and pronouns themselves or have a supervisor communicate relevant information in a meeting or via email? \n","# Additional Resources { #section-additional-resources updated=\"2025-02-24\" }\n\n### Workers’ rights toolkits { #read-worker-toolkits updated=\"2025-02-07\" }\n- The Freelance Solidarity Project’s [New to Freelancing?
